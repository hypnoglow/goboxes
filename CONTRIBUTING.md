# Contributing to `GoBoxes`?

I'd love this library to be expanded and improved. There are some obvious areas
that might need refactoring, feature additions, or a documentation. Contributing
to this project is fairly easy. Just read on :smile:

## What contributions are needed

1. Unit tests
2. More features
3. Documentation

## How do I contribute

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch `feature|bugfix|refactor/the-feature` in your fork.
3. Push your feature the feature branch
4. Create a new PR
